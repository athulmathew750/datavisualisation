Key Insights

Technology and Office Supplies are the strongest revenue contributors.

The Furniture category generates high sales but poor profit performance due to heavy discounting.

Discounts show a clear negative relationship with profit.

Some states generate healthy sales but result in negative profit.

Standard Class shipping consistently provides stronger profitability compared to Same Day shipping.

Corporate customers contribute more stable profit margins compared to the Consumer segment.

Business Recommendations

Reduce or restructure discounts on low-margin categories such as Tables and Bookcases.

Reevaluate pricing and cost structure within the Furniture category.

Limit Same Day shipping to high-value customers to improve profitability.

Address logistical inefficiencies in loss-making states.

Adjust discounting policies for high-sales but low-profit customers.

Focus marketing and retention strategies on the more profitable customer segments.
